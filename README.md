# Project Name
> In cancer, there are over 200 different forms. Out of 200, melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The diagnostic procedure for melanoma starts with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Melanoma skin cancer is highly curable if it gets identified at the early stages. The first step of Melanoma skin cancer diagnosis is to conduct a visual examination of the skin's affected area. Dermatologists take the dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions by the high-speed camera, which have an accuracy of 65-80% in the melanoma diagnosis without any additional technical support. With further visual examination by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic images, the overall prediction rate of melanoma diagnosis raised to 75-84% accuracy. The project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images.

##Problem Statement
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- The dataset comprises 2357 images depicting malignant and benign oncological conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). These images were categorized based on the classification provided by ISIC, with each subset containing an equal number of images.

## Technologies Used
- Python version: 3.11.11
- Matplotlib version: 3.10.0
- Numpy version: 2.0.2
- Pandas version: 2.2.2
- Seaborn version: 0.13.2
- TensorFlow version: 2.18.0

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- The final model demonstrates a strong and well-balanced performance, exhibiting no noticeable signs of underfitting or overfitting.
- while batch normalization didn't significantly improve the validation accuracy in this particular case.
